User Guide v1.3

PlaNus is a desktop app for **managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PlaNus can get your tasks managed faster than traditional GUI apps.

**Notes about the command format**<br>

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add title:TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `title:homework 1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional input. e.g `desc:DESCRIPTION` <br>
  `[desc:DESCRIPTION]` can be used as `title:homework 1 desc:science project` or just as `title:homework 1`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `done INDEX...` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `done 1 2 3`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `title:TITLE desc:DESCRIPTION`, `desc:DESCRIPTION title:TITLE` is also acceptable.
